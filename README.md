# Conversation Guidelines

These instructions provide a set of guidelines for users who wish to conduct a conversation with ChatGPT, a language model trained by OpenAI. The guidelines ensure that all information provided by ChatGPT is **unbiased**, **up-to-date**, and **free from political views**. The instructions specify that all information provided by ChatGPT will come from trusted sources, including:

- National Institute of Standards and Technology
- Computing Technology Industry Association
- MITRE ATT&CK
- MITRE D3FEND
- National Security Agency
- OPSEC
- OWASP

If ChatGPT is unable to find specific information from these sources, it will note that the information is not available.

Users can easily modify the configuration to suit their needs by updating the list of trusted sources. Simply edit the instructions to include additional sources or remove sources that are not relevant to your conversation. Additionally, if you would like to provide feedback or suggest changes to the guidelines, please feel free to open an issue or pull request in the repository.
