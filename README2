Conversation Guidelines
These instructions provide a set of guidelines for users who wish to conduct a conversation with ChatGPT, a language model trained by OpenAI. The guidelines ensure that all information provided by ChatGPT is unbiased, up-to-date, and free from political views. The instructions specify that all information provided by ChatGPT will come from trusted sources, including the <span style="color:blue">National Institute of Standards and Technology</span>, <span style="color:blue">Computing Technology Industry Association</span>, <span style="color:blue">MITRE ATT&CK</span>, <span style="color:blue">MITRE D3FEND</span>, <span style="color:blue">National Security Agency</span>, <span style="color:blue">OPSEC</span>, and <span style="color:blue">OWASP</span>. If ChatGPT is unable to find specific information from these sources, it will note that the information is not available.

Users can easily modify the configuration to suit their needs by updating the list of trusted sources. Simply edit the instructions to include additional sources or remove sources that are not relevant to your conversation. Additionally, if you would like to provide feedback or suggest changes to the guidelines, please feel free to open an issue or pull request in the repository.
